<p>The process for placing orders for delivery is as follows:</p>

the shop number is 01428 682176</li>
<li>Orders received before 10am will be delivered the same day</li>
<li>Orders received after 10am will be delivered on following delivery day</li>
<li>If you’re able to place your order the previous evening, that’s great for us – it gives us more
time to get organised for the day ahead</li>
<li>Include your address and phone number with every order - even if you've ordered before</li>
<li>Whilst we understand you may not know our prices, we would ask that you attempt to
place an order with a minimum value of £10</li>
<li>Payment should not be made on delivery. Someone from the shop will call you to take a
card payment over the phone</li>
<p>Please note:</p>
<li>There is no charge for delivery but please try to spend £10 or more</li>
<li>We cannot hold onto orders for delivery later in the week - orders received before 11am
will be delivered the same day</li>
<li>We will attempt to substitute for products which are out of stock. If you’d prefer us not to
make substitutions, please indicate this in your order</li>
<li>We are unable to offer delivery time slots – deliveries are clustered together
geographically to optimise the number of journeys</li>
<li>We apologise for not responding to emails personally but we are very busy and very much
appreciate your business and messages of support</li>
